# Twitch Streamers
See which Twitch users are currently streaming. There is a lag between the API I'm using and changes on Twitch itself, so users who are online sometimes look like they're offline and vice versa.

## Features
- Easily add users to the array in the JS file
- Validate usernames before making further status requests
- Check for streaming updates every 10 seconds
- Show an error message if something goes wrong
- See usernames, logos, whether they're online or offline, and description of what they're streaming if online
- See all users listed, or just who's online or offline
